# flutter-valuenotifier-theme
A simple project using ValueNotifier and ValueListenableBuilder to switch between light and dark themes. The ThemeController manages the theme state, and a Switch on the screen allows dynamic changes. Ideal for scenarios where you need to manage and react to changes in a single value. ðŸš€
